    "    - Load the data witht the given functions for the TROIKA data and refrence files.\n",
    "    - run the bandpassfilter function on both the ppg and accx,accy and accz data.\n",
    "    - run the acc_mag function on the three accelerator data.\n",
    "    - runt the get_estimates function with the filtered ppg and the magnitude acc signals, this function will return the estimates and condifence.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Data Description** - The dataset consisted of ppg signals as well as accelerometers in three directions. the data even after accounting for the movement of the (using the acceleroter signals) is still noisy. maybe a second ppg sensor at another location would help making a better dataset along with labels for the activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Algorithhm Description** will include the following:\n",
    ">   - The algorithm detects the peaks in the ppg and acc signals in the frequency domain, then compare them inorder to exclude the frequencies caused by motion artifact,and chooses the strongest frequency in the ppg signal that is not in the acc frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    ">   - it takes advantage if the blood flow movement caused by the heart rate, where more heart rate is transferred to be more blood movement which what the algorithm looks at as frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    ">   - The algorithm outputs the heart rate estimation and the confidence for a total of 8 seconds, and outputs every 2 seconds afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    ">   - the algorithm can be affected by sources of noises and other noise signals \n",
    "\n",
    ">   - The algorith doesnt perform very well in stages of changing heart rate\n",
